Microscopy Metadata Specifications --> Towards v02-01
-----------------------------------------------------
These specifications are being developed as a community effort initially led by the 4D Nucleome ([**4DN**](https://www.4dnucleome.org/)) Imaging Working Group (IWG) and the Bioimaging North America (BINA) Quality-Control and Data Management Working Group ([**QC-DM-WG**](https://www.bioimagingna.org/qc-dm-wg)) to extend the OME Data Model.

The next version of the Specifications are being developed as part of a **community outreach effort** that is currently underway in collaboration with the Quality Assessment and Reproducibility for Instruments & Images in Light Microscopy ([**QUAREP-LiMi**](https://quarep.org/))

The proposed prefix for this namespace is **NBO** for 4d**N** **B**ina **O**me
